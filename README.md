## Architecture
---

Language: __Kotlin__

Architecture: __MVVM__

    -  Architecture used for app: MVVM
        - One activity with multiple fragments is used. View models associated with fragments seperate the UI from business logic.
        - Does it differ from standard architecture? No.
        - Include UML diagram if needed. NA

Dependency Injection: __Hilt__

Concurrency: __Coroutines, Kotlin Flow__

### Folder Structure
1. App module contains Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, Adapters, CustomViews, and Helper classes
2. Data module contains classes to access local storage, remote data source and their supporting classes
3. Repository module contains repositories containing business logic and background workers.
4. Common module contains data transfer object classes which help in parsing data between data source to UI
